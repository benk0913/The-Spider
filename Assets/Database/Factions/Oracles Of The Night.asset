  Description: "A powerful and secret order which trades in information and espionage,
    not much is known about the order\u2019s members. It\u2019s pyramid shape, in
    which only a delegator knows it\u2019s underlings, makes even people from the
    inside clueless about the other branches of their very own organization.\nThis
    once powerful and secret order is now on the verge of extinction. The duke\u2019s
    sudden betrayal and his inquisition's systematic witch hunt on the order\u2019s
    members recently have shown that even a secret society as powerful and influencing
    as this may crumble under the inquisitor's feet. Juliana, though, believes she
    may prove otherwise."
  HowToPlayDescription: "<u>Oracles Of The Night Scenario</u>\nYou are playing as
    Julianna, an acolyte of the well-renouned organization \"Oracles Of The Night\".
    You were sent to take over the city of Glassden hence your primary objective
    for this scenario is to gain control over 50% of the city.\n\n<u>How To Take
    Over The City</u>\nBuy Unowned Properties In The City\nTake Over Properties Which
    Are Owned By Other Factions.\n\n<u>How To Buy Unowned Properties</u>\nFirst,
    you must discover empty/unowned properties, to do so you must reveal districts
    and properties which are unknown to you. (Question Mark icon on the map)\n\nTo
    discover locations you must first research the \"Scout Locations\" tech from
    the \"Progression Tree\", this window is accessible via the \"Scroll\" button
    at the right side of the screen. (Which would give you the ability to send your
    agent's scouting)\n\nTo scout a specific location, simply right-click the icon
    on the map and then select \"Scout Location\". (The location will be revealed
    after a turn).\n\nYou may find all types of properties when scouting, note that
    empty properties are recognisable by their \"White Color\". (White - Empty |
    Brown - Independent / Unknown | Other Color - Belongs to a faction)\n\nAfter
    you know of an ideal location to buy, you may select it and Press \"Buy Property\",
    you may find this button in the \"Location Panel\" (The panel which opens at
    the bottom of the screen when you select a property.\n\n*Note that whenever you
    buy a property, you automatically set an agent to own it for you.\n*Note that
    whenever you buy a property, the \"Select Property\" window will appear, and
    allow you to choose which role this property will have from your Unlocked Available
    Properties.\n*Note that some properties are public locations, which are not for
    sale (For example city port/markets/graveyard/constabulary/etcetera).\n\n<u>
    How To Take Over Other Factions Properties </u>\nThere are plenty of ways to
    take over a property, by arson, bribery, elimination of all potential owners,
    buying out independent properties and so on.\n\nThe most simple straightforward
    approach is to burn it, and then rebuy it. To burn a property you must make sure
    you have the \"Arson\" tech, which is unlockable in the Progression Tree.\n\nTo
    commit arson over a set property, you must first right-click it, then choose
    the \"Plot Arson\" ability and then select a Plotter, which is in charge of the
    plan.\n<u> Plotting </u>\nThe \"Plotting Window\" will appear, in it, you may
    select how this plot will be executed.\n\n On the left side, you may see your
    participants, you may add participants by pressing the \"Plus\" button. \nOn
    the right side of the window you may see the opponent's participants, those characters
    will try to defend the property.\nIn the center of the screen, you may see the
    selectable Entry and selectable Method of this plan.\nThe method will decide
    which skill will be used to commit this plot.\nThe entry may add bonuses to a
    specific skill, so the right combination of the two may be viable to successful
    execution.\nOn the bottom left side of the screen, you may see items which are
    required by your plot in order to get it executed, make sure you buy those items
    from the market first.\n\nWhen everything is ready, and you are satisfied with
    your odds of success, press the Green Button (Execute Plot).\n\n<u>Plots Execution</u>\nThe
    execution phase is mostly non-interactive, in this sequence you may see your
    agents struggling with their opponents, you may unlock unique abilities from
    the \"Progression Window\" in order to increase the chances of success.\nYou
    agents may begin with a unique method of execution (Stealth for example), if
    discovered, they will fall back to the default method of execution (Brute Force).\nYour
    agents may suffer from post battle consequences, for example, they may get arrested,
    wounded, even die during the struggle.\n\n<u>Rebuilding Ruins</u>\nA property
    which has been recently burnt will appear as a \"Ruin\" on the map, you may now
    buy it and pay a little extra to repair its damages.\n"
