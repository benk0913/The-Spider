  Description: The Constabulary (Police for in the city of Glassden) is in charge
    of enforcing the law and keeping the peace. The High Constable, Lionel Spinkel,
    is in deep trouble, his city faces a pandemic of strange abductions, which increase
    in rate every day. The lack of resolve to this situation puts the Constabulary
    and the Governing Lord in an embarrassing position. Anxious Lionel is now pressured
    to solve this problem in four weeks and keep his job as High Constable. And if
    that's not enough, he must also keep the peace in the city and his very own ambitious
    employees in check.
  HowToPlayDescription: "**If you are still unknowledgeable about the basic mechanics
    of the game, first try reading the \"Oracles Of The Night\" guide on \"How To
    Play\".\n\nThe Constabulary faces different challenges than other factions, they
    are restricted in terms of technology and will have to overcome the game's challenges
    without using crime and manipulation.\n\nGaining Resources\nThe Constabulary
    will obtain resources every turn in a continuous and steady manner, they will
    gain more in terms of \"funding\" each turn, compared to other factions, but
    on the other hand, will not be able to rely on properties to obtain gold. So
    be careful with how you spend them!\n\nPromotions \nAs a member of the constabulary,
    you must acknowledge the fact that some people might be better than you, each
    character in the ranks will slowly progress towards promotion. When promoted,
    the character will replace its employer and the employer will be fired.\nIf this
    employer happens to be you, YOU will be fired and LOSE THE GAME.\n\nSkilled characters
    will progress faster than less talented ones, so these are the ones you should
    monitor first.\n\nYou must be creative with solving these problems, the most
    peaceful approach to this is \"Stealing The Credit\" of your employee's hard
    work.\n(This requires a specific tech to be unlocked from the progression window)\n\nKeep
    Your Employees Satisfied\nMembers of the constabulary which hate you may decide
    to slack off instead of doing their work, or even leave the organization altogether.
    These will most likely be your most skilled personnel since they are the ones
    you may have to tackle the most, so, pleasing your employees is important. One
    of the best ways to do so is with hefty \"bonuses\".\n(This requires a specific
    tech to be unlocked from the progression window)\n\nQuestioning\nQuestioning
    characters is a vital part of investigations. Quests which are a part of the
    investigation may require you to question a set character, this is done simply
    by finding the relevant character and sending an agent to question it.\n(NOTE
    THAT THIS REQUIRES \"Constabulary\" TO BE UNLOCKED IN THE PROGRESSION WINDOW)\n\nTip:
    A good idea to first research the character you are about to question, you may
    want to send an agent which is talented with skills that counter the skills of
    this character.\n\nWhen questioning has begun, a specific window will appear.
    Your goal is to empty your opponents \"Deck\" of answers, doing so will result
    in success.\n\nWatch out for your own agent's \"Deck\" of questions, if it empties,
    you may lose the questioning session and have to start again.\n\nQuestions Types
    VS Answers Types\nTo empty the opponent's deck and win, you must counter his
    answers with fitting questions, questions originate from a type (skill), and
    will beat only a specific answer type (skill).\nFor example, \"Menacing\" beats
    \"Intelligent\", and therefore a \"Menacing\" question should be used when the
    opponent's current answer is \"Intelligent\".\n\nWait, but how do I know what
    the opponent's answer is?\nGood question, the opponent's answer has a \"?\" symbol
    instead of the type next to it. Note that the text may hint on the type of the
    answer, if you are still unsure about it, you may try experimenting with your
    questions and see if any of them fit.\n\nWhat do I do if I have no fitting question
    for their answer!?\nIn this scenario, you may have to \"Spend\" your questions,
    instead of using them. This is done by \"Right-Click\"-ing them. Each type of
    question will have a different effect, which may change the state of the match."
