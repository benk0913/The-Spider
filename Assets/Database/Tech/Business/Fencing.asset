  Description: 'Even the most inexperienced of thieves will not steal something they
    can not sell.

    Some of the items stolen may themselves act as evidence to
    your crimes. Fortunately the god has given us middlemen, experienced in finding
    the right customer for the right product.

    <color=yellow> This will allow
    you to sell items for their full and original price in exchange for a sum of
    connections. </color>
