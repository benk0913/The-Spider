  Description: '"What we originally planned to do, of course," Julianna says, maybe
    it is not as so obvious to them as she thought, "Force Lady Fayette to pay ransom
    for Ron''s return. Doing otherwise would simply say ''The Oracles Have Failed'',
    or ''The Oracles Were Moved By Her Actions'', we haven''t failed, quite the contrary,
    she now has no other choice but pay us and admit failure."'
