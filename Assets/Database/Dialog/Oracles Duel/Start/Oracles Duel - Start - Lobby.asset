  Description: '''Shivering'' steps forward, with the tiniest grin on his face, he
    will not answer this question, that is his principal characteristic after all.
    Chaotic electrical signals nearly shoot her heart out of her chest. It is time
    to act, talk has failed and she is one step closer now to a miserable death.'
