  Description: The two face each other, weapons of war in their hands and panic fuelled
    silence. The blue tone of the moonlight covers the room, it is unusually bright.
    Tonight the moon is as full as it gets, the sky is as clear as it gets, indicating
    winter may soon come to an end, just like your life.
