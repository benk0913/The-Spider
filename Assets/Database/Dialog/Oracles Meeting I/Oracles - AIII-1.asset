    now turning her head to each member of the group \"so professional you have let
    the entire order go extinct by the doings of a duke who doesn't even put on his
    own socks alone.\" - Now Julianna is with the accusing finger, yet the intense
    anger in her chest has sharply tuned down and replaced by fear, as she noticed
    the coldness generated towards her.\r"
