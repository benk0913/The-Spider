  Description: Three polite subtle knocks, hopefully echoing louder on the other
    side of the door. A manservant opens the door and welcomes Julianna inside with
    a calm gesture. He, for once, seems unaware of the uneasy situation. Maybe her
    paranoid anxiety is not shared by everyone today. Maybe some have a good and
    a simple, regular morning.
