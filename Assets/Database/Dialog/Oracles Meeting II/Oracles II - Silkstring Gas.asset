  Description: Julianna tries to secretly open the bottle under the table, it fizzles
    and splutters so badly as soon as she does, hiding it would not make a difference,
    she simply sets it on the table and for an eerie moment everyone in the room
    is looking at her and it silently, a bang launches the gas away to spread in
    the room, so quickly and suddenly the entire room becomes misted by a dark purple
    colour. The gas is so shockingly dense, she could barely hear the coughs of her
    past colleagues, less than a meter away from her.
