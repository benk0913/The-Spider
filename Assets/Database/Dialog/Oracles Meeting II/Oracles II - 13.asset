  Description: '"I''ve been in this game for a long time too, mind you." Mr K says
    from the other side of the table. "And my experience also tells me this opportunity
    is too rich to avoid, her son; alone, in our territory, a valuable asset we must
    not let slip away.", a smile creeps into his expression, "I don''t mind hiring
    an entire company of armed mercenaries just for this job if I must.".
