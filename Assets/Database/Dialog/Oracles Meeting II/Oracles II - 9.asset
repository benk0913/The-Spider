  Description: 'Opal pulls out a different note and starts reading, "Ron Fayette,
    son of the notorious ''Seamstress'' is currently on a trip to the city of Glassden.",
    she nods towards Julianna. "The purpose of this trip is to take part in Jeremy
    Rowanson''s funeral, an old friend of his, it seems. The ''Seamstress'', his
    mother, presumably had more goals for him to achieve in this city but this topic
    is still in the shadow for us." '
