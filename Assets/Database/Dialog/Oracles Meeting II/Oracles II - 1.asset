  Description: Once again, Julianna is on a trip to the outskirts of town, an old
    abandoned manor house, standing isolated, not by a river, nor a high hill. No
    road safely leads there, no local guide may even acknowledge the place. Even
    the most curious of the wild animals in the area seem to avoid walking by that
    manor. The impracticality of this place makes Julianna wonder if it was initially
    constructed to just be abandoned then and there, maybe it is, like a lot of things,
    just a result of naive stupidity.
