  Description: This is it, now you must leave. Julianna stands up, recalls the approximate
    location of the door and runs. Someone attempts to tackle her on the way out
    but fails. Julianna turns her head shortly as she runs, who did that?  for a
    moment she could see the facial elements of Mr K, fading away in the gas mist,
    falling away.
