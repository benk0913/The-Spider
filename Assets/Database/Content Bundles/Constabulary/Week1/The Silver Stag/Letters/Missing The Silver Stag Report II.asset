  Title: Missing The Silver Stag Report II
  Description: "To the High Constable's eyes only,\nGood news, I believe we have
    found the hideout! \nIt is shaped like a small wooden fort, reminds me of my
    own youth in a way. After raiding the place thoroughly we have found strange
    documents in a few drawers, they are filled with strange scribbles that make
    no sense, I would humbly admit that I am too incompetent and have no idea how
    to read them. Maybe you do, they are attached to this letter.\nThree of them,
    each letter found in a different stash.\nThere is another one I've found which
    IS readable but filled with nonsense."
