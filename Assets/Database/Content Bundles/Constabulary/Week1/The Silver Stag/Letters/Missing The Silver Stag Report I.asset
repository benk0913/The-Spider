  Title: Missing The Silver Stag Report I
  Description: 'To the High Constable''s eyes only,

    Beatrice has asked me to
    write the following letter, directly to the high constable:

    Dear Lionel,
    all of my hopes are set on your shoulders, John is a great person, a kind and
    loving brother, a chivalrous knight, a promising commander, he did a lot for
    our realm and he well deserves our worries in these dire times. John had a hideout
    in the woods when we were young, he used to go there with his noble posse and
    play. He called it "His Castle", the day he finally stopped was the day of his
    draft to the army. I think searching for this "hideout" may point us in the right
    direction. I, unfortunately, don''t know where it is.'
