  Title: Missing Jacob Mudborn I Report
  Description: 'To the High Constable''s eyes only,

    Talking to Jacob''s Family
    has led to a few conclusions it seems,

    Jacob was a happy, easy-going and
    well-mannered person. He loved his wife and daughters and he loved working in
    his smithy. He had no enemies nor debts to anyone, his health is fine and he
    is in good shape. He just sometimes gets to drink too much but never did anything
    bad to anyone as a result of that, his daughters say he is a kind father with
    a good heart.'
