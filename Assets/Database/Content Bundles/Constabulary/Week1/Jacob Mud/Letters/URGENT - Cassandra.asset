  Title: URGENT - Cassandra
  Description: "To Lionel Spinkel, High Constable and captain of the guard. \nFrom
    Richard Goldtower, The Lord's Hand. \nYou clearly are either too ignorant or
    don't care to understand the risks and consequences of your own actions. Cassandra
    Van Der? Do you know who she is? Release her immediately, arresting a member
    of the Van Der family, even with an official and just decree this action would
    have been a mistake. Couldn't you simply arrange a meeting first?\nVery disappointing.\nRelease
    her, the lord will now have to compensate her for your mistakes."
