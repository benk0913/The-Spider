  Title: Missing June Willingham Report
  Description: 'To the High Constable''s eyes only,

    Harold Sand has told us
    he spoke to June a lot, she was new to the sailing business but took everything
    enthusiastically. "I have a special place in my heart for her" I quote, he seemed
    very fond of the young girl, praising her charm and kind heart. "I immediately
    knew something was amiss, she seemed very happy with her new job, besides, she
    didn''t even come back to taker her payment, and she has a hefty sum left for
    her.". No sailor has seen her as well.'
