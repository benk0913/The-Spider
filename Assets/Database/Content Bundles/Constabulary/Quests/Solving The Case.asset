  Description: 'The Lord''s hand has commanded you to immediately begin investigating
    the sudden disease of kidnappings in the city of Glassden. It is now up to you
    and your constabulary force, letting this problem slip from your hands will most
    likely result in the impending end of your career, and who knows, maybe even
    your life.

    You must not fail him.


    <color=yellow>To progress this mission,
    you will have to meet with the hand and answer his questions when the time comes.
    Until then, work on the cases in detail, question the people involved, arrest,
    interrogate, raid, do whatever it takes to investigate the source and reason
    for the problem.</color>'
