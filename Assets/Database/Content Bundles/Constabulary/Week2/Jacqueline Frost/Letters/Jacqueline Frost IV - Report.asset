  Title: Jacqueline Frost IV - Report
  Description: 'To the High Constable''s eyes only, a sweet and smart orphan called
    Ben Bobach: "I saw Jessica Bennet, giving Jacqueline a letter when Suzanna didn''t
    look! Jacqueline was lame with sharing this letter with us until trickster stole
    it from her drawer! It was for nothing because Jacqueline is the only orphan
    that can read. So I told trickster to give it back to her!"'
