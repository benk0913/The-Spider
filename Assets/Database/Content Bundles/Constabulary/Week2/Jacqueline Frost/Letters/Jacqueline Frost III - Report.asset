  Title: Jacqueline Frost III - Report
  Description: To the High Constable's eyes only, hearing that orphan get nicknames
    if their chosen name was unknown is news to me. I felt odd calling this kid "Trickster",
    but I'd say his name is well earned, he was unbelievably annoying, I bet he will
    stay there forever, couldn't manage to fish out any information about Jacqueline
    from him.
