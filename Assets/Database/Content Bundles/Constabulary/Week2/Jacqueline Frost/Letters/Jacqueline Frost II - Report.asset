  Title: Jacqueline Frost II - Report
  Description: 'To the High Constable''s eyes only,

    Jessica Bennett has been
    very patient with the questioning, she seemed surprised and obviously devastated
    to know that Jacqueline had disappeared. She seemed to be interested in Jacqueline''s
    adoption and felt heartbroken about the fact that she left, or worse, got abducted.

    I
    must also add that something is fishy about her.

    Can''t point out what or
    why. She seems overdramatic about a person she only met once.'
