  Title: Missing - Jacqueline Frost
  Description: Jacqueline Frost, a poor orphan, only 13 years old, had vanished from
    the orphanage two days ago at night. The owner of the orphanage Suzanna Tenrivers
    had said that none of the children in the orphanage nor any of the children who
    sleep in her room noticed her disappearance. The only clue they have got was
    the window, which has remained wide open throughout the night.
