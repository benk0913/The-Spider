  Title: Jacqueline Frost I - Report
  Description: 'To the High Constable''s eyes only,

    Suzanna has told us that
    she picked Jacqueline from the streets 3 years ago, she has been a brilliant
    child, wise, kind, far more impressive compared to the other children in the
    orphanage, and everyone liked her.

    One potential client had recently arrived
    in the orphanage and found Jacqueline very impressive, she had seemed to be interested
    in her adoption but eventually left without any confirmation, Suzanna says she
    suspects her, but can only recall her name, "Jessica", and how she looked like.'
