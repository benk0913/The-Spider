  Title: Missing The Silver Stag Report III
  Description: 'Jessica Bennett has been very patient with the questioning, she seemed
    surprised and obviously devastated to know he hasn''t been seen for a month.
    She also claims to not have seen him for years and felt heartbroken about the
    fact that he returned and did not tell her.

    I must also add that I have
    a gut feeling about her.

    Something is amiss, I''ve seen people losing their
    beloved ones, her response is too... Dramatic.'
