  Description: Lionel Spits, "Eating the hearts of the kind, the smaller fish, as
    your cult of lunatics repeats over and over, we are the bigger fish, proud, scummy
    noble men and women, their riches and rank are not enough, greedy for more power,
    more respect, they will step over our head without even noticing."
