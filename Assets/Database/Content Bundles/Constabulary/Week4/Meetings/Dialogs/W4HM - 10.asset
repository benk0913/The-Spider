  Description: '"I hope you two will learn from your mistakes, it is only my kind
    and generous heart which lets you out of this mess unpunished." Lord Howund says,

    me to spend way too much on your stupid mistakes." he points his finger at Lionel,
    - "Yes, My lord, I won''t repeat that mistake."
