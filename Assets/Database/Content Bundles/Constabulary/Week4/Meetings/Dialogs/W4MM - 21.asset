  Description: Lionel could have easily missed the small group that gathered by the
    Hunter's Lodge, hooded and armed men in disguise, waiting in silence, they seemed
    to not be bothered nor suspiciously check Lionel when he approached, they fully
    expected him, Richard did not even think Lionel would have had the guts to turn
    against him.
