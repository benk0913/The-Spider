  Description: 'This had seemed to rouse everyone, to everyone''s surprise, Lionel
    had made Richard''s claim absolute, and the Duke, a tyrant as well as a culprit.

    sound of metal sliding on metal, a sword out of its sheath, the only mark that
    signalled we are beyond words by now, and the Duke, past redemption.'
