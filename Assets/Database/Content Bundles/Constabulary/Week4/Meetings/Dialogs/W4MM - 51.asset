  Description: 'Lionel had never been in a battle, he had forever portrayed himself
    as a coward. If one could call this one a battle, a scene more similar to a lynch
    in a side street, the hoard of hooded revenge seekers faced no resistance.

    All
    he had did was to shake his sword and add a few shouts to this deafening composition
    of madness.'
