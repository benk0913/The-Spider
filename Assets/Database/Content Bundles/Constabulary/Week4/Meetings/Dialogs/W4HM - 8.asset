  Description: '"Jessica Of House Bennett would be released, she will be sentenced
    instead by Lord Bennett for treason. Under interrogation, she had said that 
    the Duke himself, Alfred Of House Jost, has been hosting sinister ceremonies
    and murderous activities in which the heart of a kind human being is consumed
    by a party, for he is the smaller fish being eaten by the bigger ones." Richard
    is stopped by Lord Howunds hand on his shoulder. "Which are treacherous and disgusting
    lies coming out of a young lady''s sinister mouth." He continues.'
