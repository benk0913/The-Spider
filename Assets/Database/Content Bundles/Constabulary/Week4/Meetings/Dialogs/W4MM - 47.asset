  Description: Lionel does not seem to care for Alfreds theories, "And finally, back
    to my name." he continues, "You knew I was after you, that's how you know my
    name so well, for I am just a constable, serving the hand in person, not even
    a part of the Lord's council, but you know my name because you knew I was getting
    close, and you did not like it."
