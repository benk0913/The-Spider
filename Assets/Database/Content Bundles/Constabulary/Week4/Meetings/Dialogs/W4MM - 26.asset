  Description: For a while, it seemed like she didn't know where she is going, the
    forest gave no hint on anything suspicious, it was as silent dark and as horrifying
    as it is every night. It was only when unnatural yellow dots have appeared in
    the distance, light which had been well concealed behind the mass of trees and
    terrain.
