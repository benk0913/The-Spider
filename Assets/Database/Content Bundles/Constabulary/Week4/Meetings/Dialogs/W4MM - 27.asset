  Description: 'The camp was surrounded by a perimeter of carriages and carts, like
    a small fort in the forest. Three campfires were set inside, each surrounded
    by a different group of people, one by servants, one by guards and the last by
    what it seemed like nobility. They were not plenty, especially when compared
    to a Duke''s party of companions. '
