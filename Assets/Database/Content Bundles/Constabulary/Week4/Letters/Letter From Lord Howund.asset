  Title: Letter From Lord Howund
  Description: To Lionel Spinkel, the Lord Hand seems somewhat reluctant recently,
    something is wrong with him. I allow you to repay for your mistakes, all I require
    is that you may simply report to me about anything suspicious that he does or
    says. And Lionel, do not forget whom you have sworn an oath to. Your Noble and
    Kind Lord.
