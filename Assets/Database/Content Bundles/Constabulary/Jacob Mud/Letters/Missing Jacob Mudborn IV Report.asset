  Title: Missing Jacob Mudborn IV Report
  Description: 'To the High Constable''s eyes only,

    Cassandra did not spill
    any interesting facts about the case, unfortunately. She has contacted Jacob
    in order to make a commission for a new sword. She was fairly impressed by him
    and invited him to eat together with her sister, Joyce Van Der, two weeks before
    his disappearance, and after that, they parted ways.'
