  Title: Missing Jacob Mudborn II Report
  Description: 'To the High Constable''s eyes only,

    Terry Tenrivers, Jacob''s
    best friend, was definitely worried about his absence, he was very cooperative
    but didn''t know anything of great importance, his impression of Jacob is that
    he is simply a kind and hardworking man.

    He noted that he remembers Jacob
    talking about his recent client, Cassandra Van Der, Jacob''s recent client, a
    noble lady, "Maybe she has a clue."'
