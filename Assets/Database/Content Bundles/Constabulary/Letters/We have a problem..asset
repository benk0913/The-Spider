  Title: We have a problem.
  Description: "To Lionel Spinkel, High Constable and captain of the guard. \nFrom
    Richard Goldtower, The Lord's Hand.\nI have never seen a high constable so incompetent
    and ignorant as you are, Lionel. You may claim this is a personal insult but
    my words are based on the current state of the city. No city in history has ever
    seen such a high rate of abduction! This is a disease, and the state of this
    mess has not changed for an entire year now. The people question the existence
    and purpose of the constabulary, even in the presence of our Lord, Count Howund.
    This can no longer continue, I must give you an ultimatum and a very clear one.
    \nYou have four weeks to solve this problem.\nYou and I shall meet at the end
    of every week and discuss your progress."
