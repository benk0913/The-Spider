  Title: Missing June Willingham
  Description: 'To the High Constable''s eyes only,

    June, a mercenary sailor
    for the Merchants Guild, has recently disappeared after docking in the city.
    She had two days to spend before the ship leaves for another voyage, but she
    never returned. No one knows of any family or friends, our only contact is a
    guild''s agent in the city, who''s fond of her.

    I believe we should start
    with him since he is the only one.'
