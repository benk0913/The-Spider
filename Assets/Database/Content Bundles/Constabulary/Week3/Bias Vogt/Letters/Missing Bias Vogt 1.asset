  Title: Missing Bias Vogt
  Description: 'To The High Constable''s eyes only.

    Hilda seemed extremely worried
    about her father Bias, she said he behaved strangely in the last few months,
    busy with letters and work. She always knew he had one best friend who must know
    more about this, she managed to convince him to cooperate and write you a letter.
    The letter is attached to this one.

    She also collected all of Biase''s secret
    letters, she said she can''t read but hopefully, the constabulary may be able
    to.'
