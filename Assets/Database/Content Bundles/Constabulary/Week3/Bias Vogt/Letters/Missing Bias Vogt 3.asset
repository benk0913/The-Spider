  Title: Missing Bias Vogt III
  Description: 'To the High Constable''s eyes only,

    Elice of house Jost has
    been very patient with the questioning, she seemed surprised and obviously devastated
    to know that Bias had disappeared. She said he was like a father to her, and
    that she and her older brother, Alfred Jost, only wanted to dine with him and
    enjoy his wise tales.'
