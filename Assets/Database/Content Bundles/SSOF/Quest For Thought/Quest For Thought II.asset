  Description: "The \"Real Saint Alice\" takes interest only in big or significant
    cults, unlike ours, which is small and meaningless to her.\nShe will most likely
    visit the city if our \"heretic and sinister\" cult would grow too big and powerful
    to ignore.\n\n<color=yellow>\nThe number of members in your cult should increase
    in each turn by chance.\nYou may increase this chance by having more cult members.
    \nThe more cult members in your cult, the faster it grows.\n</color>\n\n<color=yellow>To
    force the cult's growth, a good idea may be to convert imprisoned characters
    into cultists.</color>\n\nThis action will result in their immediate release
    but may advance our cause in the right direction."
