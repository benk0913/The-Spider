  Title: About Saint Alice
  Description: 'Greetings, Master.

    We have extracted some odd information from
    this lady, Saint Alice. During interrogation, she claimed to not be the real
    Saint Alice but a clone, a fake puppet so espionage against the real person would
    be sabotaged by misinformation. I did not buy to this at first claim but only
    after we didn''t find that relic she supposedly owns. What else could we do?
    She also said the "Real Saint Alice" is serving the church by destroying heretic
    and sinister cults in the realm. Maybe we may use that to draw the real one into
    Glassden.

    You are the largest fish and our guiding light, master.'
