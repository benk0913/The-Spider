  Title: Sacred Shrine Raid Report
  Description: "Greetings Master,\nThe Sacred Shrine was, apparently, well defended
    by extremely fanatic worshipers, those seers came out of nowhere and tried to
    play with us. They had no idea who they were messing with.\nWe kept one alive
    for \"Field Interrogation\", it took some time, but fortunately, we were out
    of no-where and could make as much noise as we wanted.\nThe strange seer had
    eventually broken under our interrogation and told us where it is. \nMay the
    biggest fish have the upper hand!"
