    hopefully found the rune we were looking for. \n\nGLASSDEN - Our City\nNORTHERN
    - North of the\nFOREST-- Forest...\nLEAIFER- ???\nSHRINE-- Indeed the only one
    out there is probably the one we have already raided\nBURIED--\nUNDER---\nALTAR---
    And that is where I've found it.\nA revisit to that sacred shrine and a shovel
    is all it took for us to dig out this rune and bring it to you.\n"
