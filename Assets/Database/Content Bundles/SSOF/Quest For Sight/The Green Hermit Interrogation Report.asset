  Title: The Green Hermit Interrogation Report
  Description: 'The Green Hermit did give us a fight, he is a tough man, but a man
    after all. All men bend to our interrogations eventually. You don''t have to
    be so uniquely sophisticated when it comes to it. He told us of a secret shrine
    hidden among the trees and valleys to the north of Glassden.

    May the largest
    fish stand tall and true.'
