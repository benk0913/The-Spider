  Title: The Scroll Of Blood
  Description: "To My Dear AJ, \nUnfortunately, we have failed to crack Melma's cypher,
    no reference about the scrolls nor the cypher exists in the entire Library of
    Cassapali. \nSad and disappointed, we today embark on our journey back to the
    city of Glassden. But worry not, the search will continue, they say human ingenuity
    can not create a cypher which human ingenuity cannot resolve.\nMay the bigger
    fish remain stubborn and hopeful."

  SideNotes: I may have to research this encryption myself after all.
