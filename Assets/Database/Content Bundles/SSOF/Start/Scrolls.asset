  Description: 'You were right, the scrolls are in-sight.

    We have found three
    of a thing, searching day and night.

    The first is at your hospice,

    The
    second requires malice,

    The third owned by Saint Alice.

    So to avoid
    malpractice, I may leave it to your justice.

    Pry open the vice,

    which
    held tight by these mice,

    and obtain the device,

    which I hope will
    suffice.
