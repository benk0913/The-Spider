  Title: The Scroll Of Sight
  Description: 'I''ve followed your visions to the southern part of the city''s wilderness,
    after a two day''s search we managed to track an individual which roams around
    this part of the valley, human tracks, no doubt about that, and the only tracks
    we have found. If that is not a clue, I don''t know what is.

    This hermit
    may have the Scroll Of Sight in his or her possession, if not an idea to where
    it might be.

    May the bigger fish have luck with this one.'
