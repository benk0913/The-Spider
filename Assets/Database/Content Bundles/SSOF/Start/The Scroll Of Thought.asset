  Title: The Scroll Of Thought
  Description: 'The priest was already dying when we met him, old and sick, he could
    barely complete a sentence, but we made sure he''d tell us everything before
    he passes away. In short, some fine lady nicknamed and widely known as "Saint
    Alice" had inherited a unique heirloom from this very priest. The "Scroll of
    Thought", the one we are supposedly looking for, is stored inside the heirloom,
    the only way to read it properly is to break the heirloom and gut it out. I hope
    that information is sufficient for you to act.

    May us bigger fish make the
    right decision.'

  SideNotes: Finally, a smaller fish to devour.
