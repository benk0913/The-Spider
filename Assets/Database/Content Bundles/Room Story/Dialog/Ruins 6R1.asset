  Description: 'At the end of the path on the right and after a wooden door, Julianna
    finds a small room, it appears to have been a storage room of some sort, filled
    with crates, barrels, and boxes of all sorts. In an old and damp condition.

    Julianna
    doesn''t have enough time to search through this entire room, her torch will
    die out much before the task is completed.'
