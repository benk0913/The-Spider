  Description: '"Dear Stranger, I am the last one to inhabit this cave, and soon
    to leave it for good. My colleagues and I spent a span of five years in this
    secret cave. We have made great things come true from operating within these
    walls. Unfortunately, our deeds will be left secret forever after, a thought
    that saddens me deeply, these men and women deserve more than that. I would have
    written and documented our story for I had more than one sheet of paper here
    with me, and the courage to defy our master. But I have neither, hence, I will
    only leave this box, it contains a collection of items which broadly symbolize
    our saga in this place.'
