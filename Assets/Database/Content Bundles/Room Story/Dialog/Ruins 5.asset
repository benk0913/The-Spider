  Description: 'The room is quickly revealed under the light of her torch.

    This
    place is clearly in ruins. Old wooden benches, tables and pottery remain half
    broken at the sides of the hall, in their midst could be spotted here and there
    statues like her own in different colours and shapes, but in a very poor condition.

    At
    the end of the hall, a locked wooden door, which probably leads to another hall.'
