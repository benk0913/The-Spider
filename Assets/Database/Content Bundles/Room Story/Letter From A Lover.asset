  m_Name: Letter From A Lover
  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  Title: My beloved David,
  Description: By the time you'll read this letter, it will be three months, three
    months since we last met, I miss you so much. I haven't seen your reply to my
    previous letter, so I assume something bad has happened to it along the way,
    please, write again your thoughts to me, I've longed to read your unique point
    of view about these things. I miss your voice, your touch, your energy, in a
    month I will be back in your hands! This voyage has been too long, I've grown
    seasick, it has become tedious. I know it's important but it is still a torture
    to me. I just want it to end, the crew has been unusually competent, we made
    a three months progress in one, harvesting all types of seaweed I've never seen
    before. But I care less now, I miss you, that's all I think about. Tell me about
    your research! Could you remain focused after I left? Do you feel the longing
    as well?
  SideNotes: 'This letter probably belongs to the previous owner of the manor.

    Mr
    K never told me what happened to him.'
  From: Yours Forever, Karen O.
