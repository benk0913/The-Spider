  Title: Julianna, I've found Karen
  Description: in a restaurant by the city port. after a short, pleasant inquiry
    about David's whereabouts, the previous owner of the Manor, she has told me he
    never wrote back, not to this letter nor any other letter she has sent. When
    she returned to his manor, no one was home. So she assumed he just grew tired
    of her. She has shown much more interest in helping me after I told her he has
    just simply disappeared. She has told me David had a secret room behind his workroom,
    that he used a lock on the wall behind the closet to open it and. Also, she has
    told me that he had a unique custom made combination box which holds the key,
    and finally, she added that he used an ancient and unique cypher, which he was
    very proud of, to communicate with his colleagues.
  SideNotes: That may prove useful
  From: Your loyal agent.
