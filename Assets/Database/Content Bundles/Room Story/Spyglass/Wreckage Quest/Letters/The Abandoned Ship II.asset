  Title: The Abandoned Ship II
  Description: "As for what we have concluded and gained out of this endeavour;\nI
    honestly don't know, I'll leave it for you to figure out. \nAnd as for the property;\nI've
    spoken to a bookkeeper about this ship, he has told me that, by law, the first
    individual to step on the wreckage in uncontrolled waters is entitled to own
    all of its property rights, hence this property is now in our possession."
