  Title: The Abandoned Ship I
  Description: 'Greetings Julianna, I have been to this mysterious ship of yours.
    What I''ve seen there is beyond ordinary, the ship seemed abandoned from first
    glance, this was our assumption until we arrived there and saw the captain. The
    ship had an undescribable stench of rotting corpses,  he was dead, he managed
    to somehow tie himself tightly to the wheel of the ship, his body, his corpse
    when we have found it, has been rotting there for a few days. Then we tried the
    lower deck, this experience I would have never experienced in my worst nightmares,
    dead scattered all over the place, unimaginable horror of stench and rotting
    corpses in the dark, in short, I rather not recall these details, unless you
    insist of course.
