  Title: The Goose Statue
  Description: you have made the right choice by choosing me, since I know a lot
    about these, this specific statue is wonderful, it has been kept in a superb
    condition, I deeply envy you and would be open to offers if you intend to sell.
    As for its story, it was most likely discovered in a network of caves which is
    located west of Glassden. A cave within a crevice has been home for spies from
    the era of Aaelek, we are talking two hundred years ago. Those spies used different
    statues to communicate secret messages, this specific one means "Beware" or "Something
    wrong has happened." Along with that technique they had an additional way of
    communicating, some sort of a cypher. This is what I and my team are organizing
    at the moment, we aim to send another team of skilful researchers to those ruins,
    we still lack funds, but, if you are interested in starting this excavation,
    an investment may get things up and running, and you may get a cut of the earnings!ema
