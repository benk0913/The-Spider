  Title: Hanna's Letter III
  Description: 'David, I have recently completed a more extensive research about
    this mutual subject of ours. I must admit, I have more questions than answers
    at this point. The tales about Melma The Wise have commonalities between them,
    they are all focusing on the same things: finding the truth, superiority over
    other tribes, and more than anything, the same metaphor about the bigger fish
    consuming the smaller fish one and how this is the most basic and natural pattern
    in life. The emphasis on consumption is also strangely and confusingly big, it
    is also needlessly detailed.'
