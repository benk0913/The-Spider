  Title: Hanna's Letter IV
  Description: "David, I am very sorry for leaving you in the dark, I didn't write
    back because I had to meet my family back in Sentient, my father is sick, I have
    never seen him like that, he is tired and old, I may not see him again. \nI currently
    fight with the urge to stop writing and face my grief but I must not, this is
    because I am worried about you, I may be too late but I strongly discourage you
    from following this group, what I read about Melma and his followers was not
    pleasant, they seemed to be a hostile and ruthless group, I thought this point
    was irrelevant but I also didn't know it will come to this, DO NOT go there,
    I DO NOT RECCOMMEND THIS, please trust me."
