  Title: AJ's Letter III
  Description: Dear B.V, I must admit I feel a great bond has been created between
    you and I. You are like a son to me. I will be honest, it deeply saddens me to
    see you in that state. A reflection of my youth. I used to walk on earth confused
    and in doubt, lacking this remedy I've found three years ago. Today I feel strong,
    focused and motivated, just like Melma The Wise of the ancient writings. Today,
    I aim to become his successor, I aim to revive the great feats of ancient times
    and put this world on a better path.
  SideNotes: 
  From: May we become the biggest fish, your friend, A.J
