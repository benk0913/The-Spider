  Title: Hanna's Letter I
  Description: 'Dear David, it is nice to read your letters again, being honest,
    I thought I will not hear from you again. As for your question, unfortunately,
    no, I do not know of this Elice nor anything about "A.J" rings a bell.

    But,
    I find this very interesting. Who is Melma? I''ve never heard of such a name
    or tale. "Bride On The Hill"?, he did note that it is ancient, so, I better start
    searching more about it for you. I will write back again in the following days
    or at least summarize what I''ve found.'
  SideNotes: 
  From: Hannah.
