  Title: Hanna's Letter II
  Description: David,I have followed your advice and started with the library, my
    search began with ancient characters and historic figures, nothing about Melma
    The Wise, but I had a hunch about this, something had told me it has to do with
    a religion of some sort, maybe it was this A.J's irrational optimism. In short,
    I have found it, "The Bride On The Hill" it is a tale about Melma his sons and
    his followers. He seemed to be the head of some spiritual group, a strange one
    I will be honest, they talk in terms of tribes, superiority and bigger fish consuming
    the smaller. You should definitely get your hands on another letter from that
    B.V.
