  Title: AJ's Letter II
  Description: To B.V, I was very excited to read your letter, your passion for our
    special sect fuels me with energy, I am anxious to tell you about our recent
    ceremony. But this must be kept to another time, the tale of these experiences
    deserves more than a simple letter. And they ARE experiences, believe me, I have
    seen my apprentices experiencing what it is to see and understand pure TRUTH
    for the first time, I really believe that a wise man like you will find this
    Truth fascinating.
  SideNotes: 
  From: Always the bigger fish, your friend, A.J
