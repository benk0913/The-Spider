  Title: AJ's Letter IV
  Description: B.V,  It is time, I can no longer let you breathe the stench of doubt,
    the coldness in your heart, when you feel you are alone and small in this world,
    you are mistaken, you are not alone in this world, you have us and we have you,
    we have found each other not by mistake, fate has brought us together. We shall
    meet on the first moon, exactly one week before the month of the rat, month second
    in importance only to the month of the fish. Elice will arrive in the same location
    you met for the first time, she will take you there, you may join us, and then
    we may finally be together as one strong family, no longer alone, no longer in
    doubt.
  SideNotes: 
  From: On this day you will become the biggest fish, A.J
