  Title: Strange Letter IV - Agents Report
  Description: We used the cover of darkness to find that white boat, there were
    two of them, one seemed old and quite abandoned and the other well maintained.
    My gut feelings have pointed at the old decrepit boat. I knew this is the one
    you were looking for, your kind usually hide their mysteries in mysterious places
    just for the show. There was no need to search for anything really, a single
    box with a single letter was waiting for us there.
