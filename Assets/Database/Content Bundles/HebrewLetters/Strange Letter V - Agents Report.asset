  Title: Strange Letter IV - Agents Report
  Description: 'What a trickster you are Julianna, the northern wilderness is full
    of caves. All kinds of caves, big caves, small caves, dark caves, flooded caves.
    We have found the right one eventually, it was set in a convenient place, fortunately
    for us.

    The box was just like the last one, but this time did not contain
    a letter but something else... Along with a hefty amount of gold.

    It will
    be sent to you as soon as possible.'
