  Description: Lady Fayette seems to have forgotten you don't deal in such petty
    matters, but if you want to get your hands on this new "Vial of Doom", so to
    speak, you may have to abide. <color=yellow>Simply gather 50 Connections </color>,
    they will be spent as soon as you reach 50 points, to... by all means, spread
    the wizard's forthcoming and tales of valour.
