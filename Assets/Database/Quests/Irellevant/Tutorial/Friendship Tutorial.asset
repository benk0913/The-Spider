  Description: Jeremy probably stores the item we are looking for in his house. But
    we don't know where he lives. And we may already foresee that he won't simply
    tell that to a stranger. To find out where he lives, you may want to get closer
    to him, one of the ways is to simply befriend him, get one of your agents to
    do so.
