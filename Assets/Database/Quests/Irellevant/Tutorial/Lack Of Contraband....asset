  Description: 'Now you know where Jeremy''s house is located, but there still remains
    that one obstacle before us, and it is his front door.

    It is probably protected
    with a lock, this requires us to obtain a <color=yellow>lockpick</color>. The
    easiest way is to buy a lockpick from a <color=yellow>Black Market Vendor</color>.
    This city is impressive in it''s lack of smugglers, a feat even more impressive
    for a coastal city. Not for long.'
