  Description: As you can see, a rumor has been gathered, some may be valid, some
    may be not, but they could help you pin point the target's current location.
    Take some time and gather rumors, you may use an additional agent to speed it
    up, when you are certain you have found the target's location, 'right click'
    on the target location and send someone to spy there for anyone important.
