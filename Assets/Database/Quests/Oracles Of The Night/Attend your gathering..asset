  Description: 'You are now the Oracles leader.

    As the new leader you must now
    call your acolytes in to a gathering and discuss the future of the order. The
    primary subject in this case is the ransom of Ron Fayette, son of the ''Seamstress''.
    You have crushed her plan to retreive him by force, now she is defeated, pushed
    to the corner, and would probably pay almost any ransom you may decide on.'
