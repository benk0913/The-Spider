  Description: "It seems like Lady Fayette's spies have managed to track who's in
    charge of Jeremy's death. She has pulled some strings and paid for a local rival
    faction to engage you, <color=yellow>survive 2 days of their harassments</color>,
    this will buy Mr K enough time to distract her somewhere else. \nYou <color=yellow>could
    instead try to destroy them</color> but that will probably prove <color=red>MORE
    DIFFICULT</color> than to just survive."
