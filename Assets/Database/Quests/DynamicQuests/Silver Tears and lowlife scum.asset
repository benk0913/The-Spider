  Description: "It is a sad sight every time to encounter these bagger kids on the
    streets, one would assume all they care  about is their next meal, but sadly,
    in our cruel reality that they just want another portion of silver tears. Systematic
    smuggling and bartering has got them hooked on the drug as well as anyone else.
    Unavoidable, I know, but still cheap in my opinion, After questioning some of
    them and researching their suppliers I\u2019ve got to a conclusion. Most of the
    drug supply in the city comes from  a single smuggling operation, on that side
    of town."
