  Description: Rumors from within the city's law enforcement tell of a ship that
    is for some strange and unknown reason being held for a very long inspection.
    It is said that this is not the first time this ship is held for inspection and
    last time all it contained is large amounts of dried red meat. I'll be honest
    with you, why everyone cares about this ships contents so much is beyond me,
    it is non the less, in a vulnerable position and ripe for raiding.
