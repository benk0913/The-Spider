  Description: 'Rich clients of a specific tavern have been overheard bragging about
    them being offered a cup of the rare and expensive "blue wine" which this tavern
    keeper allegedly stashes somewhere in his storage room. a luxury he "only reveals
    to his most appreciated clients". If you are not above trusting the word of a
    bragging merchant then I''d recommend you to plan a raid on this tavern''s storage
    room.
