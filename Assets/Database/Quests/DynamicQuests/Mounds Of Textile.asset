  Description: Ships containing textile usually tend to get stuck in our port for
    a long time due to further inspection by the city's constables, since they are
    often suspected to be made by illegal laborers. Don't be fooled though, this
    act of justice is not as noble as it might seem, the authorities tend to get
    bribes from these ship captains, who already expect this bureaucratic process.
    Well now we have an opportunity, the sailors are in a sticky situation, their
    ship is at bay waiting while they are being interrogated a perfect time to strike
    on their cargo which should contain probably nothing but textile.
