  Title: URGENT!
  Description: 'Mr K is dead! How or what happened is beyond me, but Acolyte Beatrice
    has recently reported that she saw him dead in the gathering room. I suspect
    the deed was done by Lady Fayette, the only enemy we know he had. Opal, Sedrick
    and ''Shivering'' have either become victims of her doings or gone rogue. Therefore,
    I would HIGHLY recommend you to NOT cooperate with any letter you have received
    that has Mr K''s seal on it.

    Wait, don''t do anything, just wait for us
    to figure this out.
