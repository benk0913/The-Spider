  Title: What a mess...
  Description: 'You have done it. You have single-handedly destroyed all of what
    we had, all of what''s left from our order. Mr K is dead, The ''Seamstress''
    has won her son back, our reputation is in the mud and therefore, you have lost
    my trust aswell. My hands are trembling right now because of you, they make writing
    this letter difficult, a letter you don''t even deserve. You are the worst and
    most stupid acolyte this order has ever had.

    Even Fayette, the one which
    you have loyally delivered her son to, won''t hire you because of your incompetence.

    I
    am out, and so is Beatrice, I hope we may never meet again.'
