  Title: Progression
  Description: "Juliana, I figured you already have recruited an agent or two to
    your cause, now, since you are not well established yet, a wise decision may
    be to meet with them. Sit and discuss what options are available and what things
    may be done in order to advance your team in the city.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll contact
    you soon. Make sure you come back with conclusions by then.\r"
