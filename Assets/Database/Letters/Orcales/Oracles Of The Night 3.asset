  Title: Orders III
  Description: "Juliana, I see you have already figured out what could be done, out
    of all things, I\u2019d recommend to first focus on espionage, teach your agents
    to scout and hunt for locations of interest around the city. \r\nThat\u2019s
    all for now, I\u2019m working hard to make sure the order is back in action.
    Assume the next letter will contain updates on what has been done, and what is
    expected of you, as a high ranking associate.\r"
  SideNotes: "\"Mr K\" is trying to fool me around again, I don\u2019t believe he
    is really in control of the order or capable at all of sorting things as well
    as he claims he does."
  From: 'Mr K. '
