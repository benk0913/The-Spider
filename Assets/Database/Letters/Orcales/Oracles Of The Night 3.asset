  Title: Plan The Right Thing
  Description: "Juliana, I figured you already have recruited an agent or two to
    your cause, now, since you are not well established yet, a wise decision may
    be to meet with them. Sit and discuss what options are available and what things
    may be done in order to advance your team in the city.\nI\u2019ll contact you
    soon. Make sure you come back with conclusions by then."
  SideNotes: "\"Mr K\" is trying to fool me around again, I don\u2019t believe he
    is really in control of the order or capable at all of sorting things as well
    as he claims he does."
