  Title: Real-Estate
  Description: 'Dear Juliana, you have been doing well lately, not as well as I have
    ideally wanted, but not so bad at all.

    The issue is that you don''t have
    a passive income, soon you will become destitute and what then? You can''t rely
    on me to fund you, your operation must live off its own crops. I know that you
    don''t have experience in real estate, but our line of work requires this experience
    as well as any other.

    I''d start with investing in a tavern, which besides
    a continuous flow of gold also acts as a hub of rumours and potential connections.
    Thank me later.'
  SideNotes: What an interesting way to say "I am a cheap bastard."
  From: Mr K.
