  Title: Gathering
  Description: Julianna, time is of the essence, Ron is on his way, we must get to
    work at once. What you have to do is simple, first bribe the High Constable.
    In the meantime I'll contact a friend of mine, Dora, she is in Ron's circle,
    and may know more about his companions. She is quite secretive though, so she
    will probably contact you via an encrypted letter, you already know how to deal
    with those. I'm afraid she uses a different cypher though. After this preparation
    is complete, you may be at the safest point to assault the funeral and abduct
    Ron. God Speed.
