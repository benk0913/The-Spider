  Title: Orders III
  Description: "Dear Juliana, our order is currently blind to what\u2019s going on
    in the city. This is unacceptable. \r\nOur motto, agenda and sole purpose is
    to know things. We need to know more about the city. Send your agents to explore
    more, all they did by now is sit and talk, get them to do something.\r\n\r\nKeep
    me notified,\r\n"
