  Title: Congratulations
  Description: 'Greetings, Julianna, that was close. I am happy to inform that Lady
    Fayette will no longer chase you and your small gang. The valiant efforts have
    proven impressive none-the-less, because of that, I hereby promote you to a rank
    of ''Acolyte''. Therefore you may now be invited to our gatherings, which include
    all remaining acolytes of the order.

    An invitation has been sent to you
    in the shape of an <color=yellow>encrypted letter.</color>

    Get used to those.
    It will detail the location, date and time of the meeting. The letter is undisclosed
    and so must not be seen by anyone.

    As for the encryption, <color=yellow>it
    is using the simple "Letter Shift Cipher", learn about this technique and use
    it to decrypt the letter.</color>
