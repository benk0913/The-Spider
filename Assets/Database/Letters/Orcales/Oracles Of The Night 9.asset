  Title: Incoming Trouble
  Description: Julianna, It seems like Lady Fayette's control over the city is more
    impressive than we thought, she has tracked your somewhat incompetent breadcrumb
    droppings and now probably knows who she's dealing with. I've also heard she
    has hired the services of a local gang, sailors it seems, a faction which is
    already stationed in the city. They will attempt to engage if not destroy you
    in retaliation. Stay strong, we are currently working towards a distraction in
    a different city. This may cause her to shift focus and leave you be. Until then,
    DON'T LET HER CATCH YOU!
