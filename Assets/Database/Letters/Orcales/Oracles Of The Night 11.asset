  Title: Congratulations
  Description: Julianna, I assume you are not satisfied with this new tax demand.
    You must understand, this is essential to our cause, especially in these days.
    Your help will not be forgotten and compensation will come sooner or later, you
    have my word. On another matter, something big is planned to come soon, and you
    have a part in it. Until then, I'd advise you to prepare and expand, take over
    the district of Windgate, make sure you are the only contender left there.
  SideNotes: 
  From: Mr K.
