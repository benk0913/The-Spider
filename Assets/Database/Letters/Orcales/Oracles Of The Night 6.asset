  Title: Acquisition Of Goods
  Description: 'Juliana, I can see you have been acquiring properties lately, it''s
    good to know that you have listened to my advice and opened a tavern. Just because
    you are so cooperative, I''ll send you a small gift of recognition. While we
    are still in the search for more gold, I''d also recommend you to use this gift
    and upgrade your tavern, maybe host an event in it for the extra gold.

    On
    another note, I may require your assistance soon, with a job I need getting done
    under your supervision.'
