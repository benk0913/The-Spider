  Title: To my new master.
  Description: 'I''ve heard the news, Julianna, I admire your prowess, you are something
    I have yet to encounter in my line of work. Nonetheless, in these times, we must
    be practically short and rational, so excuse me for writing again about subsequences.
    Opal and Sedrick are eliminated, ''Shivering'' is no where to be found and Mr
    K is dead. I believe we all agree that you are definetly his successor, I would
    gladly work for such a powerful order.

    Honestly speaking, I admire you the
    most because you took my word in this matter, despite the fact that we quarrelled
    more than once in our past.'
