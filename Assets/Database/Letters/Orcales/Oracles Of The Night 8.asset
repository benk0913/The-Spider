  Title: Farewell Jeremy
  Description: 'Grand, from what I understand, Jeremy''s body is now on floating
    in the ditch, on it''s way to Abathon coast. Lady Fayette will not know where
    this came from, she won''t suspect us though, they think we are extinguished.
    Let them think so. Since you are such a valuable problem solver, I''ll grant
    you a gift, this acts as a token of your better than the average job. Don''t
    get used to it, members of our order don''t expect rewards for their contribution.

    As
    for what''s next, keep on expanding, I''ll keep in touch soon, with more work,
    whether you are ready for it or not. So be ready.'
