  Title: Farewell Jeremy
  Description: 'Grand, from what I understand, Jeremy''s body is now on floating
    in the ditch, on it''s way to Abathon coast. Lady Fayette is a shrewd and experienced
    player in this game of spies, she won''t let this go so easily.

    It''s only
    a matter of time until she finds out who plotted Jeremy''s death.

    Therefore
    we must prepare for possible future attacks on your establishments. Spend the
    following week recruiting guards for your properties, set patrols and acquisitions
    of more vassal joints which may take the fire away from your manor.'
