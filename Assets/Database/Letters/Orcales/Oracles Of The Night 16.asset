  Title: You have my blessing.
  Description: "Wow, Julianna, I didn't expect this to escalate so quickly. \nI have
    to admit I was wrong about you, you have shown everyone the result of what happens
    when you try to mess with our order. You delivered Fayette's arse right back
    to her and on a plate of silver. Crushed those damned traitors, Opal and Sedrick
    along with every other hireling she got involved. I was wrong about you, you
    are far more dangerous than any of us, even our poor Mr K was no match to what
    you did right now. You have my loyalty and my devotion, be certain of that."
