  Title: URGENT!!!
  Description: This is important, Julianna, get to preparations as soon as possible,
    Opal and Sedrick have tried to play you for a fool, they are the ones who sent
    you this letter, they are the ones who killed Mr K. I suspect "The Seamstress"
    gave them an offer they couldn't refuse. They are after you, ALL of them, Fayette,
    her colleagues, Opal and Sedrick, they come for Ron and for your head. Acolyte
    Beatrice is on her way to your city, I will come thereafter, worry not. More
    coin and resources have been sent to your cause, I hope that will suffice.
