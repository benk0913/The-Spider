  Title: Recruiting Agents
  Description: "Dear Juliana, I\u2019ve picked you of all people to re-establish
    operations in this city. I hope you understand that I provided this opportunity
    to you because of the high potential I see in you, now you were given a one of
    a kind chance to elevate yourself in our order, embrace it.\nBecause you are
    unfortunately inexperienced in such matters and need guidance, I may take the
    role of your supervisor. For the time being. \nMy first recommendation would
    be to recruit at least one agent, so tasks around the city may be delegated to
    him, or her."
  SideNotes: "\u201CMr K\u201D is lying, he did not really prefer me over other agents,
    his only reason is that his other agents are now dead. I am the only one left.\n"
  From: 'Here to help, Mr K. '
