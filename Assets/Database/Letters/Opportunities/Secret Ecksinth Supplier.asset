  Title: Secret Ecksinth Supplier
  Description: "Trailing back different drug suppliers and abusers has led to one
    common source, a specific shopkeeper which owns a failing store, hidden in a
    back alley all of these notes hint to the fact that this shopkeeper may have
    a large stash of the infamous Ecksinth drug in his or her possession. I would
    recommend you to sniff around there or send a crew and pay a visit .\r"
