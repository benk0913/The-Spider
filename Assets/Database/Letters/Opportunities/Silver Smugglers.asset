  Title: Silver Smugglers
  Description: After connecting some lines together it is now obvious, someone has
    leaked the fact that this "Smugglers" Operation has connections with the colonies
    at the western continent and recently managed to smuggle a shipment of ornaments
    made of solid silver... If that rumor is correct the shipment of silver should
    be stashed in their hideout.
