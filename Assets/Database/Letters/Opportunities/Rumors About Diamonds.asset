  Title: Rumors About Diamonds
  Description: "They say sailors have recently started polluting the streets, these
    sailors seem to be just a small delegation of a large expedition which recently
    stationed in our port for resupply, one drunken sailor blubbered about a lump
    of diamonds she and her crewmates stumbled upon in one of their many voyages,
    she couldn\u2019t hold her mouth about how hard it was to hide this from her
    previous captain and claims the diamonds are secretly stashed in among the ship\u2019s
    other basic supplies."
