  Title: Bold Drug For Bold Smugglers
  Description: Rumors conclude that a group of brave smugglers have managed to put
    their hands on an expensive drug called Ecksinth. These bold smugglers are in
    a rush to turn a profit from this drug, and behind your back as well! Id recommend
    you to show them who's boss and pay them a visit. This is based on speculations,
    though, pretty solid ones speculations non the less.
