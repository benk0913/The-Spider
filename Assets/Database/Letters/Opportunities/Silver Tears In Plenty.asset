  Title: Silver Tears In Plenty
  Description: The streets were flooded recently with a rare powder called "Silver
    Tears", tracing the supplier was not an easy task. I suspect a specific shopkeeper,
    which seem innocent to the naked eye but surely owns a large sum of it. It also
    seems like he is in haste to get rid of the cheap substance so I'd recommend
    you to take action as soon as you receive this letter.
