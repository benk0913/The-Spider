  Title: Contraband Goldmine
  Description: "Whispers tell of an indiscreet employee which recently leaked information
    about a large storage room filled with smuggled contraband which has been hoarded
    over the last few months. The fencer in charge appears to be incompetent in getting
    rid of it and still falls behind the smuggling rate. I\u2019d say a nice stamp
    on his career, would be to raid this storage room and take everything he hoarded
    by now, and maybe a fine lesson on why you should dispose of these items as soon
    as you get them, too."
