  Title: Gold From The Faraway Shores Of Alexandria
  Description: "A rich merchant arriving from Alexandria has recently docked in our
    city, it appears some of the city\u2019s wealthier residents are this merchant\u2019s
    clients. I would use my best assumption and suggest that his cargo contains some
    merchandise made of pure gold, if not full of it. Merchant\u2019s almost sole
    reason to visit the far shores of Alexandria is it\u2019s relatively vast supply
    of gold, sold in cheap."
