  Title: Silverware, a new trend of the cultured class.
  Description: "It seems everyone wants it, silverware! spoons, forks, knives, made
    of pure silver.A shiny, pretty, expensive and somewhat rare metal. Our city\u2019s
    lucky members of the upper class have finally started getting their piece of
    the pie when an ambitious merchant recently got silver shipped in to our port,
    he now spends time looking for the finest workshops in the city, so he may invest
    in them and craft silverware out of his ingots, silver bars which sit untouched
    on his ship. A perfect opportunity to strike and cash in on his merchandise!
    I wouldn\u2019t feel bad if this also delay the extravagant luxury a little more."
