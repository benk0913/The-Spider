  Title: Gold Smugglers
  Description: After connecting some lines together it is now obvious, someone has
    leaked the fact that this "Smugglers" Operation has connections with the colonies
    at the southern continent and recently managed to smuggle a shipment of ornaments
    made of pure gold! If that rumor is correct the shipment of gold should be stashed
    in their hideout.
