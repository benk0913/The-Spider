  Title: The Production Line
  Description: 'One might wonder why the "County of Silkstring" is so prosperous,
    the reason is quite simple: Brains. Talent, experience and knowledge. The Silkstring
    society is earning well simply from good ideas. One does not have to waste his
    life over a field of rice and fight for survival each day.

    This city''s
    major export, on the other hand, is politics, crime and illegal goods. This will
    soon be changed, we will make sure of that.

    We shall establish an industry
    here. This has been a brief of the idea in macro. The specific instructions will
    be delivered to you in small drops, as you progress with the creation of this
    production line.'
