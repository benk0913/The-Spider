  Title: The Gas Formula - Stage II - Silkstring Chemical Lab
  Description: 'The final stage in the production line is done by the Silkstring
    Chemical Lab. It will process the mix of the Ecksinth Drug and the Silver Tears
    Powder and create Bottled Toxic Silkstring Gas. This gas is highly dangerous
    and requires an antidote to being consumed by the handler no more than 10 minutes
    before the exposure.

    Note, you are required to manufacture 5 packs of Silkstring
    Gas. This will test your newly made industry. Failing to prove high performance
    will prevent us from revealing the antidote.'
  SideNotes: 'The quest will teach a new Progression Item: "Silkstring Chemical Lab"'
