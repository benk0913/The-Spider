  Title: Congratulations
  Description: On a personal note, I hope you did not take the recent events personally.
    Rulers tend to kill each other all the time, with or without this weapon. There
    is no honourable weapon. There is no good or bad in this business, for it is
    just a business. I may donate 10% of our revenue to the sick and homeless if
    that would put your conscious at ease. Yours, Mr Kane Kolker, The Wizard Of Silkstring.
  SideNotes: --I'm not sure why this name seems so familiar.
