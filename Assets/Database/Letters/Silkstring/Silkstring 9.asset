  Title: Congratulations
  Description: Finally after years of work, we successfully enterprised this facility,
    this new weapon of war will potentially take over the market, soon enough. People
    of power have no way to fight this weapon, they will therefor buy it, since we
    have no competition they will not negotiate prices with us. But first, we must
    advertise. Make an example, show no lord is above this weapon. We shall begin
    with the local ruler, Lord Sherrod, destroy his castle with gas and you will
    be highly rewarded. Trust me, this will ignite the fire called Silkstring Gas.
