  Title: 'The Gas Formula - Stage I - Silver Tears Acquisition '
  Description: Silver tears are an important substance in our production line, they
    are mixed with Ecksinth to create our secret gas. Silver Tears are ironically
    cheap. Why Ironically one might ask. Because they are illegally imported from
    afar. From a remote desert in the lands of Astasia. How it became so cheap compared
    to the Ecksinth is beyond our knowledge. The only way to acquire this powder
    is with the help of skilled smugglers.
