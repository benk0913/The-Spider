  Title: Well Done
  Description: Well done Julianna, you don't know how glad, relieved and content
    I currently am. I have been planning this for the past three years now. Yes,
    I know, this act was evil, I know, I should not be excited about it. But there
    are things which must be done. I have left my agency in the city in your hands,
    They surely may be of assistance to you, especially with Sherrod's inevitable
    revenge over his son, let's hope he blames the wrong people in this case. As
    for our collaboration, my interests in the city of Glassden are buried with this
    claimant. Therefore, you will not hear from me for a while. But, we should honestly
    meet! me and you, and celebrate this victory, one day.
  SideNotes: 
  From: The Seamstress.
