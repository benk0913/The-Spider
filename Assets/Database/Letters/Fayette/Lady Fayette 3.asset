  Title: The Antidote
  Description: Julianna, we are progressing in the right way! Today, I received no
    less than SIX bottles of the substance we previously spoke of. Dangerous stuff,
    and supremely powerful, I have made sure one will be delivered to your door.
    Note, we still can not use it, yet, an antidote must be acquired first, so the
    handler may not be affected by his own blast, hence, his offer is on the table.
    The wizard will share his Antidote recipe if we may use our connections to spread
    the news of his arrival as well as promote his name among our colleagues.
  SideNotes: 
  From: The Seamstress.
