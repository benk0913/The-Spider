  Title: Partnership
  Description: Greetings, player, I assume you already know me, and imagine you may
    see me as an enemy but we both know it does not have to be like that. For us
    players, it's simply a chess game. You have proven yourself as a valiant player,
    one which I have mistaken for a mere piece. This was a silly mistake, I admit.
    Before you burn this letter, think about the current state of affairs, and about
    our potential mutual interest, for that is what's important, your own good. If
    you do, let me know, I have an offer for you.
  SideNotes: '<color=red>WARNING: Replying to Lady Fayette may ruin the relationship
    with Mr-K</color>'
  From: Lady Fayette, The Seamstress.
