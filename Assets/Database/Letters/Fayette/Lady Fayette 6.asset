  Title: Destroy The Oracles
  Description: 'Greetings, I believe it is time for me to share my real business
    in Glassden. The local ruler, the Count, "Lord Sherrod of House Howund" is married
    to my sister, together, 6 years ago to be exact, she has brought him an heir,
    "Spencer". A single heir and his only son, to this date. Unfortunately for both
    of us, "Spencer", is my heir as-well, since my next successor in line is his
    mother, and her, "Spencer". Lord Sherrod knows this very well, yet, still too
    naive to see the danger this fact brings to his son. He probably does not see
    me as potential kinslayer.

    Finish the job I started, get rid of this child,
    I will be forever in your debt.'
