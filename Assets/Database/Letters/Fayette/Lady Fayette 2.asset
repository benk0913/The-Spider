  Title: Working Together
  Description: I'm glad to know you are intrigued by my offer, and therefore, able
    to understand there are things more important than espionage and treachery. Today,
    a colleague of mine, known as the 'Wizard Of Silkstring' has asked for my assistance
    in his current project. He is in the making of a magical bottle, which is capable
    of withholding demonic spirits, death magic. a dangerous weapon! One I wish to
    have my hands on, he promised me that I may utilize this weapon as soon as I
    help him dock his ships unmolested in the city of Glassden, the first step would
    be to bribe the head constable, so the wizard's ships may not be searched upon
    arrival. I need you to do that.
