  Title: Destroy The Oracles
  Description: Julianna, I have delivered you the antidote, now with both of those
    items, you may actually be able to use this weapon. I believe you understand
    what must be done now, the remnants of your order have no place in this world,
    attend their meeting and show them the wrath of Silkstring. I know, this may
    be hard, but only the ruthless and strong survive in our little game. After these
    remnants are dealt with I may officially acknowledge you as the new and true
    Oracles Of The Night leader. As the head of this ancient order.
  SideNotes: 
  From: The Seamstress.
