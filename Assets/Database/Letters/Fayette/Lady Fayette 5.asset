  Title: Destroy The Oracles
  Description: 'Julianna, I am proud of you, you have officially proven your decision
    to choose the winning side. Today is a special day, in which our official collaboration
    has begun. To prove you I entrust you with this ordeal, I ordered my spies to
    henceforth be subject of your rule in the city of Glassden.

    With your influence
    and my help, we became the most powerful force in its underground community.'
  SideNotes: -- I now have control over Lady Fayette's properties.
  From: Yours, The Seamstress.
