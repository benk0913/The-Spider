  Title: Smuggling Operation
  Description: "Blessings from the northern seas to you Juliana,\r\nAn old frien,
    I assume we both know as \u201CMr. K\u201D, has told Smuggler John of your recent
    arrival to the city. Many a smugglers like Smuggler John have been eager to operate
    in this city for a long time now. For some reason none of us could find a good\u2026
    \u201CInvestor\u201D whom may receive our wares in open hands. Now an opportunity
    arises which Smuggler John mustn\u2019t let go!\r\nAnd the opportunity is you!
    \u201CMr K\u201D claimed you may be of assistance in this case and help both
    you and Smuggler John get rich. All Smuggler John is really asking is for you
    to rent a warehouse near the coast which may buy and store Smuggler John and
    his colleague\u2019s goods. And which may take care of the \u201Ccover up bureaucracy\u201D
    for them. Smuggler John\u2019s natural skills already cover up for him.\r\n\r\nDelighted
    to hear more from you.\r\nSmuggler John is known as Smuggler John among his partners
    but you can call Smuggler John just John.\r"
  SideNotes: It seems this Smuggler want's me to hire a warehouse in the city.
