  Title: Bad news...
  Description: 'Greetings, I figured it is past time to tell you about it.

    {Target_Name}
    disappeared just last night, or during the day, it took some time to notice...

    For
    no clear reason, to be honest. I suspect even there may be a kidnap.

    Who
    knows.

    In any case, I figured it should be reported...

    I''ll try to
    look around in the meantime.'
  From: 
  Seal: {fileID: 0}
