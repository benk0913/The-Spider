  Title: To your eyes only
  Description: "Dear Juliana, I\u2019ve recently been having a very sad and unfortunate
    week.\r\nA colleague of mine stopped writing back, for a while now. I decided
    to check on his house, myself. He just suddenly disappeared, for no apparent
    reason. Absence like this, in our line of work, points towards the obvious, some
    misfortune happened to him. Although I feel very sad, irritated, and even paranoid
    about this recent misfortune, I figure we must do something about it. So I decided
    to pick you, due to your high skill and vast potential, as a replacement. This
    is a promotion, and naturally, you will be tested. Please, depart as soon as
    you receive this letter, settle down in his stead.\r\n\r\nMay we suffer no longer
    from misfortunes such as these.\r\nFrom your dear friend and colleague,\r\nK.\r\n"
