  Title: A snitch!
  Description: ' As I have previously suspected, it appears {Target_Name}, our {Target_Role},
    has broken under interrogation and snitched on some of us!

    The constabulary
    will probably look for those he told on in the following days, I believe some
    action should be taken to counter that.
