  Description: 'Your agents, disguised as mysterious visitors from the sea, claim
    they need to get rid of these whiskey barrels in a hurry, and will unfortunately
    have no option but to leave them as a gift to the establishment.

    After
    these barrels are properly stashed inside, the fire lit would be even greater!
