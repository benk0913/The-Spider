  Description: The purple mist of the gas could be seen from miles away, like a magical
    cloud of death, covering the castle's tower. It didn't take long for the city
    to fall into anarchy, even the forces of the constabulary couldn't meet with
    the disaster, a sad story and a terrifying one aswell. The tragic story has become
    common in the lower and higher class alike, putting everyone on the edge, and
    in fear of the magical death that has suddenly struck the land.
