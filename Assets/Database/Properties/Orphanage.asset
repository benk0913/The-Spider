  Description: 'The Orphanage is a place of piety, which runs *almost* always by
    men and women of great virtue.

    The orphan''s dirty and struggle-full life
    gives him the stimulation to do dangerous and shameful things. A dirty and poor
    orphan blends well within the crowd, mostly because people often prefer to look
    the other way, when a starving kid is walking about helpless, looking for food.'
